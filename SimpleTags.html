        only one body of your code!-->
        <h1>Heading 1</h1> <!--the biggest header-->
        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
        <h3>Heading 3</h3>
        <h4>Heading 4</h4>
        <h5>Heading 5</h5>
        <h6>Heading 6</h6> <!--smallest header-->
        
        <!--paragraph 1: Paragraphs, more like pair of Graphs-->
        <p>This is a paragraph. It has an opening and closing tag.
            Anything block of text can go here. Because we added no breaks, this will print
            on one line even though the text is on multiple lines in the text editor. Watch, I'm going to click ENTER
            . ENTER AGAIN
            ..again?
            All in one continuous line. 
        </p>

        <!--paragraph 2: BreAkS-->
        <p>This is another paragraph, but this time <br>
            ..there is a break!<br>
            Breaks don't need a closing tag fyi :D <br>
            I put one after each statement. 
        </p>
        <br> <br> <!--secret break, did you notice?-->

            <!--paragraph 3: Bold vs Strong-->
            <P>
                This paragraph will contain strong vs bold. They both have ending tags. Ok so strong and bold
                looks the exact same; however, the purpose behind it is different. The semantics of it all!
                Bold is when you want attention to a word. Like I need to buy
                <b> eggs</b>, <b> oatmilk</b>, and <b> bananas</b>. I put bold markers on each word.
                Now strong is when you want you want to convey something important like <strong>stand clear of 
                the closing doors please
                </strong>. You know like in the subways! I believe screen readers interpret these differences differently so yeah
                still important! One invokes a feeling, other is purely show.
            </P>
            
            <!--paragraph 4: Emphasis vs Italics-->
            <p>Just like the last tags, we have two tags that display the same, but the semantics/meaning is different.
                We have Emphasis vs Italics. One is a feeling, the other is simply for looks. Now emphasis is when you want to really
                empahize what you are saying. <em>We </em> really need to get lock in. That's emphaszing that <em>we </em> need to 
                focus. For Italics, we use it seperate a word from text, just to show it's different. Like quoting or name of book, those
                things. Obama once said <i>"Yes we can."</i> It's a quote so I wanted to offset it from the rest of the text.

        <div>
            <!--paragraph 5: Ordered Lists-->
            <p>Ordered Lists. You use the "ol" tag with and list items with the "li" tag
                Now I want the order of meals. I'd say
                <ol>
                    <li>breakfast</li>
                    <li>lunch</li>
                    <li>dinner</li>
                </ol>
            </p>




            <!--paragraph 6: Unordered Lists-->
            <p>Unordered Lists. When the order doesn't matter, just listing stuff.
                You us "ul" to start the unorder list, then "li" for the things you are listing.
                Like for instace, what are the states of matter?
                <ul>
                    <li>solid</li>
                    <li>liquid</li>
                    <li>gas</li>
                </ul>

        <p>
            Now there is something I didn't cover. I've been putting some of these Paragraphs
            in divs. Why? Well sometimes you want to group texts to together to give them a sense
            of style. I have 2 divs. One div that has the text formats (bold, italics, strong, emph).
            The other div is around the kinds of lists. Each of my divs has two paragraphs. 
            I'm not styling them now, but if I wanted to, I could style them! Div 1, the text formats would be styled the 
            same. Div 2 would be styled next with their own kind of style. So I have all these paragrpahs,
            but since they are grouped in their own divs, they will take the style of their divs. Oh, 
            and divs can be nested. <b>Nested </b> means when you put a tag in another tag. Think of those
            dolls that you when you open one up, there's another doll inside. Nest!
