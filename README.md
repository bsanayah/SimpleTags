# HTML and CSS Notes
This repository includes basic notes from HTML and CSS. After each lesson, I tried coding myself. Each files stores as follows:

### starter-tags.html
This shows basic tags in HTML such as:
- divs
- paragraphs
- unordered vs ordered lists
- strong vs bold
- emphasis vs italic
- comments

### starter-styles.css
